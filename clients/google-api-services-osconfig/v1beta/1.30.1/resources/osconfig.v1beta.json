If there are multiple policies that specify the same config\n(eg. package, software recipe, repository, etc.), the service ensures\nthat no VM instance could potentially receive instructions from both\npolicies. To create multiple policies that specify different versions of a\npackage or different configs for different operating systems, each policy\nmust be mutually exclusive in their targeting according to labels, OS, or\nother criteria.\n\nDifferent configs are identified for conflicts in different ways. Packages\nare identified by their name and the package manager(s) they target.\nPackage repositories are identified by their unique id where applicable.\nSome package managers don't have a unique identifier for repositories and\nwhere that's the case, no uniqueness is validated by the service.\n\nNote that if OS Inventory is disabled, a VM instance cannot assign a policy\nthat targets by OS because the service sees the OS as unknown."
